# obj-file--sphere-

This code constructs 3D objects(obj files) for you resulting from the slicing of a plane with a unit radius sphere located at the origin. It can be generalised fo any aribtrary radius sphere as long as the plane is at a normal distance lessser than the radius of the sphere. 

The code specifically reads vertices, normals and faces from the verts2.txt, norms2.txt, faces2.txt files respectively. 
The test.obj file is the resultig spherical cap.
